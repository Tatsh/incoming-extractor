DC: ``.raw`` (CDDA audio)
-------------------------

Red Book CDDA ripped verbatim: signed 16-bit, 44100 Hz, stereo, interleaved, whole 2352-byte
sectors, native little-endian. Conversion is a straight RIFF/WAVE header wrap with **no byte-swap**;
a proper rip is not swapped.

DC: ``.OSB`` and ``.MLT`` (Manatee sound)
-----------------------------------------

``.OSB`` is a ``SOSB`` speech/SFX bank: a 16-byte header, an offset table of ``SOSP`` voice records,
and each record holding packed AICA voice registers (sample start, length, 4-bit ADPCM codec, and
pitch). Every record is decoded with the Yamaha/AICA ADPCM algorithm to signed 16-bit mono PCM and
written as one WAV per record (22050 Hz in the shipped banks).

``.MLT`` is a Sega ``SMLT`` multi-unit container. Its 32-byte-per-unit table (type, bank, AICA
address and size, file offset and size) is decoded to JSON.

DC: ``Manatee.drv``
-------------------

Sega's Manatee AICA sound-driver program, uploaded to the audio chip at runtime. This is executable
driver code rather than a convertible asset, so it is copied verbatim and documented only.

PC: ``.wav``
------------

Already standard RIFF/WAVE PCM, so it is copied verbatim.
