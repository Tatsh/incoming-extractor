DC: ``.PVR``
------------

A standard Sega Dreamcast PowerVR texture (a ``PVRT`` chunk, usually with a ``GBIX`` global index
header). Converted to PNG with ``spvr2png``.

DC: ``*_T.PVR`` (level texture pack)
------------------------------------

A ``*_T.PVR`` is **not** a single texture but a pack container for a whole level's textures. It
begins with a table of contents of ``(uint32 absolute offset, uint32 size)`` pairs, zero-terminated;
the table length equals the first offset. Each entry points at a standard ``PVRT`` chunk.

The last entry is short by 8 bytes (its pixel data is still complete), so the reader clamps that
final chunk to the end of the file. Each contained texture is unpacked and converted to PNG with
``spvr2png``.

Dreamcast ``*_M.BIN`` models reference textures by their index into this pack; see
:doc:`models`. To unpack a pack on its own, use the :doc:`../utilities` ``extract-pvr-pack``
command.

PC: ``.PPM``
------------

A standard NetPBM ``P6`` portable pixmap, converted to PNG with Pillow. PC ``.ian`` models reference
these through the ``.odl`` definition files; see :doc:`models`.
