Native tools
============

Some conversions shell out to native helper programs. Each must be on ``PATH`` or supplied with the
matching ``--*-path`` option. When a helper is missing, only the conversions that need it are
skipped and the affected files are copied verbatim.

is found first on ``PATH``.
